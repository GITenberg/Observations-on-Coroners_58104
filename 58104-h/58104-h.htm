<p>The importance of the subject, I humbly anticipate will be
sufficient excuse for the liberty I have taken, in dedicating to
you the result of my experience connected with Coroners&rsquo;
Inquests.</p>
<p>The instances narrated with reference to apparent
delinquencies, in non-medical Coroners, contained in the
following pages, occurred in my immediate neighbourhood, and may
be believed, as resting on the brow of truth.&nbsp; Yet I most
heartily coincide in acknowledging the integrity and worth, of
Gentlemen pursuing vocations, for which they have alone been
amply educated; and it is only when they assume a position, or
accept office to execute duties they are incompetent to perform,
as is frequently observed, that I deem it my duty to wield my pen
against such appointments: not less for the sake of humanity,
than for the dignity, and I might add, the disregarded importance
of the medical profession, to which I have the honor to
belong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is no inglorious vanity in
Englishmen to consider the laws of their country afford an
example for other nations to follow.&nbsp; Founded on the lasting
rock of integrity, shewn in the strict regard for the liberty of
the subject, they command the obedience and the admiration of
thousands.&nbsp; But events, as they transpire, unfold the
humiliating circumstance, that blemishes dimly seen in the
distance become prominent on the near approach of extending
knowledge; thus disclosing the fact, that this is a
progressionary as well as a probationary world in which we live,
and that perfection in human institutions cannot be attained,
unless, through the power of an Infinite Being, the mortal in his
earthly career be permitted to assume immortality.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Trial by
jury appears the great feature by which the laws are regarded;
and a better test for its usefulness cannot be pourtrayed than
when with becoming dignity, discrimination, and foresight, it is
employed to search into the cause of the death of a fellow
creature; consequently no judge in the lands hold a higher
position than a coroner, for almost unlimited power is allowed,
perfectly in accordance with the sacred trust imposed upon
him.&nbsp; But the responsibility attached to office, involves
duties of extraordinary character; and the public have a right to
expect that efficient pains-taking persons should be appointed,
so that enquiries should be conducted in a clear,
straightforward, impartial, manner; otherwise innocence might be
tarnished, criminals might escape, and laws&mdash;coeval with
life, framed for its protection&mdash;might be considered
non-entities.</p>
<p>Coroners are officers at common law, because they deal
principally with the pleas of the crown; and, possibly, the name
may be derived from the manner of holding the inquest in
<i>corona popupuli</i>.&nbsp; The Lord Chief Justice of the
Queen&rsquo;s Bench is, by virtue of his office, principal
coroner of England; and may, if he pleases, exercise the
jurisdiction of coroner in any part of the realm.&nbsp; In former
days they were the principal conservators, and principal
magistrates, within their counties, <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>and they may now bind to the peace any
person who make an affray in their presence.</p>
<p>The office of Coroner is of great antiquity, for in the days
of Alfred, King of England, they existed, for he punished with
death, a judge who sentenced a party to suffer death upon the
coroner&rsquo;s record, without allowing the culprit to traverse
or be tried in another court.&nbsp; Coroners were ordinarily made
by grant or commission, without election&mdash;such are the
coroners of particular lords of liberties or franchises, who by
charter, have power to create their own coroners, or to be
coroners themselves.&nbsp; Thus, the Lord Mayor of London, is by
charter of 18 Edward the Fourth, Coroner of London.&nbsp; The
Bishop of Ely also has power to make coroners in the Isle of Ely,
by charter of Henry the Seventh&mdash;Queen Catherine had the
hundred of Colridge granted her by Henry the Eighth, with power
to nominate coroners.</p>
<p>The Cinque Ports <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a> have their own coroner.&nbsp; The Dean
and Chapter of Westminster have their own coroner, who by their
appointment, is coroner of the city and liberties of
Westminster.&nbsp; The <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Wardens are coroners of the Stannaries
in Cornwall.&nbsp; The Master of the Crown Office, or Clerk of
the Crown, is Coroner of the Queen&rsquo;s Bench, and has
jurisdiction over matters arising within the prison of that court
and Marshalsea.&nbsp; He holds his office by letters patent,
under the great seal.&nbsp; In addition to which, there are many
exclusive jurisdictions and corporations, for which coroners are
appointed.</p>
<p>In each of the twelve shires, in Wales, and Cheshire, &amp;c.
there are only two coroners, which are settled by stat. 33 H. 8,
c. 13 and 34 H. 8, c. 26.</p>
<p>But the two principal jurisdictions over which by the
King&rsquo;s grant, coroners may be appointed, are those of the
Admiralty and the Verge.</p>
<p>At common law, if any felonies or treasons were committed
within any creek or arm of the sea, which was in the body of the
county, the common law courts had jurisdiction; but by stat. 15
Richard 2, c. 3, it was provided, that in &ldquo;case of the
death of a man or mayhem, done on great ships hovering in the
main stream of great rivers only beneath bridges nigh to the sea,
the admiral shall have cognizance of the same rivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that his jurisdiction extends only to rivers that
are arms of the sea, namely, that flow and re-flow, and bear
great ships.&nbsp; When the haven, &amp;c. is within the body of
the county, the <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>common law tribunals have a concurrent jurisdiction, and
the Coroner of the County as well as of the Admiralty, may take
inquisition of deaths, &amp;c. happening there.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a man-of-war was <i>infra corpus
comitatus</i>, the land coroner was holden to have jurisdiction;
and if the captain refuse the coroner admission, on board, the
court will grant an information.</p>
<p>Again the Admiralty jurisdiction extends only to such deaths,
&amp;c. as happen in great ships, and not to such as occur in
small vessels.</p>
<p>When the jurisdiction of the County and of the Admiralty is
concurrent, the coroner who first seizes the body, is entitled to
take the inquisition; and if he proceed to do so, the authority
of the other is determined.</p>
<p>The other great jurisdiction is the Coroner of the
King&rsquo;s House, usually called the Coroner of the Verge, who
it seems anciently was appointed by the King&rsquo;s letters
patent, but by stat. 33 H. 8 c. 12, the granting thereof, is
settled in perpetuity in the Lord Steward, or Lord Great Master
of the King&rsquo;s house for the time being.</p>
<p>Anciently the Coroner of the Verge had power to do all things
within the Verge belonging to the office of the Coroner, to the
exclusion of the Coroner of the County; but because the
King&rsquo;s Court was often moveable, it is ordained by stat. of
Articuli <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>super Cartas, c. 3, that on the death of a man, the
Coroner of the County shall join in inquisition, to be taken
thereof, with the Coroner of the King&rsquo;s house, and if it
happen it cannot be determined before the Steward, process and
proceedings shall be thereupon had at common law.</p>
<p>But yet in the case of death within the Verge, the Coroner of
the County cannot take an inquisition without the Coroner of the
Verge; and if he does it is void, but if one person be Coroner of
the County, and also of the Verge, the inquisition before him is
as good as if the offices had been in several persons and taken
by both.&nbsp; And though the court remove, yet he may proceed
upon that inquisition as Coroner of the County.</p>
<p>Beside those above enumerated, there are particular coroners
for each county, who hold their offices (virtuta electionis) in
pursuance of the statute 3 Edward I. c. 10, wherein it is
provided, that &ldquo;through all shires sufficient men shall be
chosen to be Coroners, of the most loyal and wise knights,&rdquo;
which <i>know well</i> and <i>may best</i> attend upon such
offices, and &ldquo;which lawfully and shall attend and present
pleas of the crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore the election of a
coroner, is by the freeholders of the county, in pursuance of a
writ, called a writ <i>De coronatore eligendo</i>, directed to
the Sheriff.</p>
<p>This statute does not define the precise number which varies
in different counties, according to <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>usuage.&nbsp; In some there is only
one&mdash;in others, there are two, four, and six coroners
appointed.&nbsp; But as no number is limited by the statute, it
is competent for the Lord Chancellor if he thinks fit, to issue a
writ for the election of one or more additional coroners, upon
the petition of the freeholders of a county, and the approbation
of the justices, certified at the general quarter sessions of the
peace, holden for the county.</p>
<p>The degree of knighthood, observes &ldquo;Sewell on the Law of
Coroners,&rdquo; is now no longer an essential qualification for
the office of coroner.&nbsp; Yet candidates for that office must
it is said, have land sufficient to take upon themselves that
degree, whether they be really knighted or not.&nbsp; They must
be possessed of an estate in fee, within the county, over which,
if elected, their jurisdiction will extend.&nbsp; The statute 14
Edward 3, s. 1 c. 8, enacts, &ldquo;that no coroner be chosen,
unless he have land in fee sufficient in the same county whereof
he may answer to all manner of people.&rdquo;&nbsp; No precise
amount of estate is defined by this statute, but the coroner
ought to have sufficient property to maintain the dignity of his
office, and to answer any fine that may be set upon him for his
behaviour.&nbsp; But if having an estate in fee within the
county, it be insufficient to answer his fines, that will not
operate as a disqualification or be a ground for his removal, if
he be of sufficient estate to execute his <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>office, for
the county, upon his default, will be liable to the fine as
punishment for having elected an insufficient officer.</p>
<p>The authority of the coroner is twofold:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; Judicial</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Ministerial</p>
<p>In his judicial capacity, he has to enquire when any one comes
to his death suddenly or violently; how and by what means such
death was caused; to pronounce judgement upon out-lawries; to
inquire of lands and goods, and escapes of murderers, treasure
trove, wreck of the sea, deodands, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Before the statute of Magna Charta, c. 17, (4,) coroners held
pleas of the crown, but that power is taken away by a more recent
enactment.&nbsp; The Sheriff in his tourne might by the common
law, inquire of all felonies, save the death of a man, but it is
doubtful whether the coroner can inquire of any felony but the
death of a person, and that <i>super visum corporis</i>, except
in Northumberland, where the coroner may, by custom, inquire of
other felonies.</p>
<p>In his ministerial capacity, he has to execute the
King&rsquo;s writs, when the Sheriff is a party to the suit, or
kin to either of the parties, or on default of the Sheriff, but
they are only authorized so to act in the execution of a process
directed to them when their acts are void, unless they all
join.</p>
<p>Coroners are conservators of the King&rsquo;s peace, and
become magistrates by virtue of their election <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and
appointment.&nbsp; This privilege, independently of their more
official duties, they are entitled at this day to exercise; and
are empowered to cause felons to be apprehended, as well as those
that have been found guilty after inquisition, as those suspected
of guilt, or present at the death, and not guilty; as also
burglers and robbers, in respect of whom, no inquisition can be
taken.&nbsp; And this, says Lord Hale, appears evidently by the
statutes, 3 Edward I, c. 94, and 4 Edward I.&nbsp; <i>Officium
Coronatoris</i>, and with this agrees the common usage at this
day; for many times the inquest are long in the inquiry, and the
offender may escape, if the coroner stay until the inquisition is
delivered up.</p>
<p>Where coroners are empowered to act as judges, as in taking an
inquisition of death, the act of one of them is of the same force
as if they had all joined.</p>
<p>The office of Coroner being by election, does not determine by
the demise of the king.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of coroners is limited to the county,
liberty, or precinct, to and for which they are elected and
appointed, and cannot be enlarged by any private act or
delegation from the crown.</p>
<p>By the common law, if a man had been stricken in one county,
and died in another, it was doubtful whether he were indictable
or liable in either; but the more common opinion was, that he
might be <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>indicted where the stroke was given.&nbsp; And if the
party died in another county, the body was removed into the
county where the stroke was given, for the coroner to take an
inquisition <i>semper visum corporis</i>.</p>
<p>But the statute 2 and 3 Edward the Sixth, cap. 24, sec. 2,
provided that when any person shall be feloniously stricten or
poisoned in one county, and die of the same stroke, or poisoning
in another county, an indictment thereof found by jurors of the
county where the death shall happen, whether before the coroner
upon the sight of such dead body, or before the Justices of the
Peace, or other Justices or Commissioners, which shall have
authority to inquire of such offences, shall be as good and
effectual in the law, as if the stroke and poisoning had been
committed and done in the same county where the party shall die,
or where such indictment shall be founded.&nbsp; This statute,
however, assumed the existence of a <i>felony</i>, and was silent
entirely as to what is to be done by the coroner or jury if no
such indictment were found.&nbsp; The effect of any other finding
was left entirely as it stood at common law.</p>
<p>It was thought, too, that the statute 2nd and 3rd Edward the
Sixth, cap. 24, did not extend to boroughs; but that in cases of
felonious killing, where the stroke, occurred out of the borough,
and the death, within, the jurisdiction of the coroner, was
according to common law.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>By the
9th George the Fourth, cap. 31, sec. 8, it was enacted, that,
&ldquo;where any person being feloniously stricken, poisoned, or
otherwise hurt upon the sea, or at any place out of England,
should die of such stroke, poisoning, or hurt in England, or
being feloniously stricken, poisoned or otherwise hurt at any
place in England, should die of such stroke, poisoning, or hurt
upon the sea, or at any place out of England, every offence
committed in respect of any such case, whether the same amounted
to the offence of murder or of manslaughter, or of being
accessory before the fact to murder, or after the fact to murder
or manslaughter might be dealt with, enquired of, tried,
determined, or punished in the county or place in England, in
which such death, stroke, poisoning, or hurt should happen, in
the same manner, in all respects, as if such offence had been
wholly committed in that county or place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the 7th George the Fourth, cap. 64, sec. 12, it was
enacted, &ldquo;where a felony or misdemeanour is committed on
the boundary of two or more counties, or within the distance of
500 yards of the boundary, or is begun in one county and
completed in another, every such felony, &amp;c. may be dealt
with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in any of the
said counties, in the same manner as if it had been wholly
committed therein.&rdquo;&nbsp; This enactment extends to the
boundaries of counties <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>only, and not to prosecutions in
limited jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Many difficulties, however, having arisen on the construction
of these statutes, as to the jurisdiction of coroner; by the 6
Vic. cap. 12, it was enacted, &ldquo;That the coroner only within
whose jurisdiction the body of any person upon whose death an
inquest ought to be holden, shall be lying dead, shall hold the
inquest, notwithstanding that the cause of death did not arise
within the jurisdiction of such coroner; and in case of any body
found dead in the sea, or any creek, river, or navigable canal
within the flowing of the sea, where there shall be no deputy
coroner for the jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England, the
inquest shall be holden only by the coroner having jurisdiction
in the place where the body shall be first brought to
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; And by sec. 2, it is further enacted,
&ldquo;That for the purpose of holding coroners&rsquo; inquests,
every detached part of a county, riding, or division, shall be
deemed to be within that county, riding or division, by which it
is wholly surrounded, or where it is partly surrounded by two or
more counties, ridings, or divisions, within that one with which
it has the longest common boundary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sec. 3 provides
for the trial of parties on verdicts of murder and
manslaughter.&nbsp; Sec. 4, provides for the levying of deodands
on verdicts.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>The
enquiry of the coroner must be restricted to the cause of the
death of the person upon whom the inquest is taken, and cannot be
extended to accessories after the fact.&nbsp; He may, however,
inquire of accessories before the fact, for such are instrumental
to the death. <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>And by the statute 7 George the Fourth, c. 64, sec. 9,
&ldquo;the offence of the person counselling, procuring, or
commanding, howsoever indicted, may be inquired of, tried,
determined, and punished by any court which shall have
jurisdiction to try the principal felon, in the same manner as if
such offence had been committed at the same place as the
principal felony, although such offence may have been committed
either on the high seas, or at any place on land, within his
majesty&rsquo;s dominions or without.&nbsp; And in case the
principal felony shall have been committed within the body of any
county, and the offence of counselling, procuring, or commanding
shall have been committed within the body of any other county,
the last-mentioned offence may be inquired of, tried, determined
and punished in either of such counties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This cursory glance of the office, the election, the
authority, and the jurisdiction of coroners, show at once the
importance of the trust imposed in them.&nbsp; Yet in the present
day negligence and laxity prevail to such an extent, that a
coroner&rsquo;s <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>tribunal is considered an inferior instead of a superior
court, for some magistrates though differently elected, endeavour
to control their labours, on the plea of economy&mdash;and this
may be considered as one cause why coroners&rsquo; inquests
appear unsatisfactory tribunals, for surely the doing so, must
interfere with the sacred duties imposed and intended to operate
on the minds of the many, that an untimely end of a fellow
creature with all the awfulness attending it, should be carefully
inquired into as the safety valve by which we live and move, and
have our being.</p>
<p>The incomparable Dickens has, in one of the numbers of his
present novel, &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; sketched a lively
representation of the manner in which these courts are commonly
conducted; and as fiction demonstrates truthfully, truth itself,
it may not be considered an unpardonable liberty in introducing
the following extract:</p>
<blockquote><p>The coroner frequents more public houses than any
man alive.&nbsp; The smell of sawdust, beer, tobacco smoke and
spirits, is inseparable in his vocation from death in its most
awful shapes.&nbsp; He is conducted by the beadle and the
landlord to the Harmonic Meeting room, where he puts his hat on
the piano, and takes a Windsor chair at the head of a long table,
formed of several short tables put together, and ornamented with
glutinous rings in endless involutions, made by pots and
glasses.&nbsp; As many of the jury as can crowd together at the
table <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>sit
there.&nbsp; The rest get among the spittoons and pipes, or bear
against the piano.&nbsp; Over the coroner&rsquo;s head is a small
iron garland, the pendant handle of a bell, which rather gives
the Majesty of the Court, the appearance of going to be hanged
presently.</p>
<p>Call over and swear the jury!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well gentlemen,&rdquo; the Coroner begins:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence there will you,&rdquo; says the
beadle&mdash;not the coroner, though it might appear so.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well gentlemen!&rdquo; resumed the coroner, &ldquo;you are
impanelled here, to enquire into the death of a certain
man.&nbsp; Evidence will be given before you, as to the
circumstances attending that death, and you will give your
verdict according to the evidence and not according to anything
else.&nbsp; The first thing to be done is to view the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make way there!&rdquo; cries the beadle.</p>
<p>So they go out in loose procession, something after the manner
of a straggling funeral, and make inspection, from which a few of
the jurymen retire pale and precipitately.</p>
<p>The inquiry proceeds.&nbsp; The jury learn how the subject of
the inquiry died, and learn no more about him.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen,&rdquo; says
the coroner, &ldquo;who I am informed was accidentally present,
when discovery of the death was made; but he could only repeat
the evidence you have already heard from <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the surgeon,
the landlord, &amp;c., and it is not necessary to trouble
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is any body in attendance who knows anything
more?</p>
<p>Mrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins.</p>
<p>Mrs. Piper sworn.</p>
<p>Anastasia Piper, gentlemen, married woman.</p>
<p>Now, Mrs. Piper&mdash;what have you got to say about this?</p>
<p>Why Mrs. Piper has got a good deal to say, chiefly in
parenthesis and without punctuation, but not much to tell.&nbsp;
Mrs. Piper lives in the court, (which her husband is a cabinet
maker,) and it has long been well be known among the neighbours
(counting from the day next but one before the half-baptising of
Alexander James Piper, aged eighteen months and four days old, on
account of not being expected to live, such was the suffering of
that child, gentlemen, in his genus) as the Plaintive&mdash;so
Mrs. Piper insists calling the deceased&mdash;was reported to
have sold himself.&nbsp; Thinks it was the Plaintive&rsquo;s air
in which that report originatin.&nbsp; See the Plaintive often,
and considered his air was fearinocious, and not being allowed to
go about, some children being timid, (and if doubted, hoping Mrs.
Perkins may be brought forard, for she is here and will do credit
to her husband, and herself and family.)&nbsp; Has seen the
Plaintive wexed and worrited by the children, (for children they
will ever be, and you cannot expect them, specially if <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of playful
dispositions to be Methoozellers which you was not
yourself.)&nbsp; On accounts of this and his dark looks, has
often dreamed as she see him take a pickaxe from his pocket and
split Johnny&rsquo;s head, (which the child knows not fear, and
has repetually called after him close at his eels).&nbsp; Never
however, see the Plaintive take a pickaxe or any wepping far from
it.&nbsp; Has seen him hurry away when run or called after, as if
not partial to children, and never see him speak to neither child
or grown up person at any time, (except the boy that sweeps the
crossing down the lane over the way round the corner, which if he
was here, would tell you that he has been seen a speaking to him
frequent.)&nbsp; Says the coroner, is that boy here?&nbsp; Says
the beadle no, sir, he is not here.&nbsp; Says the coroner, go
and fetch him then.</p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the boy, gentlemen!</p>
<p>Here he is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged.&nbsp; Now
boy!</p>
<p>But stop a minute.&nbsp; Caution.&nbsp; This boy must be put
through a few preliminary paces.</p>
<p>Name, Jo.&nbsp; Nothing else that be knows on.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t know that everybody has two names.&nbsp; Never heerd
of sich a think.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t know that Jo is short for a
longer name.&nbsp; Thinks it long enough for <i>him</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He</i> don&rsquo;t find no fault with it.&nbsp; No lather, no
mother, no friends.&nbsp; Never been to school.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s home?&nbsp; Knows a broom&rsquo;s a broom, and knows
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>its wicked
to tell a lie.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t recollect who told him about the
broom, or about the lie, but he knows both.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
exactly say what&rsquo;ll be done to him arter he&rsquo;s dead if
he tells a lie to the gentlemen here, but believes it&rsquo;ll be
something wery bad to punish him, and serve him right&mdash;and
so he&rsquo;ll tell the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do, gentlemen&rdquo; says the coroner,
with a melancholy shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you can receive his evidence,
sir,&rdquo; asks an attentive juryman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the question,&rdquo; says the coroner,
&ldquo;you have heard the boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t
exactly say&rsquo; won&rsquo;t do you know.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t
take <i>that</i> in a Court of Justice, gentlemen.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s terrible depravity.&nbsp; Put the boy aside.</p>
<p>Now.&nbsp; Is there any other witness?&nbsp; No other
witness.</p>
<p>Very well, gentlemen!&nbsp; Here a man unknown proved to have
been in the habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year
and a half, found dead of two much opium.&nbsp; If you think you
have any evidence to lead you to the conclusion that he committed
suicide, you will come to that conclusion.&nbsp; If you think it
is a case of accidental death, you will find a verdict
accordingly.</p>
<p>Verdict accordingly.&nbsp; Accidental death.&nbsp; No
doubt.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you are discharged.&nbsp; Good
afternoon.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>While
the coroner buttons his great coat, the eminent solicitor, and
himself, give private audience to the rejected witness in a
corner.</p>
<p>That graceless creature only knows, that the dead man (whom he
recognised just now by his yellow face and black hair) was
sometimes hooted and pursued about the streets.&nbsp; That one
cold winter night, when he, the boy, was shivering in a door-way
near his crossing, the man turned to look at him, and came back,
and, having questioned and found that he had not a friend in the
world, said, &ldquo;Neither have I&mdash;not one!&rdquo; and gave
him the price of a supper and night&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp; That
the man had often spoken to him since; and asked him whether he
slept sound at night, and how he bore cold and hunger, and
whether he ever wished to die, and similar strange
questions.&nbsp; That when the man had no money, he would say in
passing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m am as poor as you to-day, Jo,&rdquo;
but that when he had any, he had always (as the boy most heartily
believes) been glad to give him some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very good to me,&rdquo; says the boy, wiping his
eyes with his wretched sleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wen I see him a layin
so stritched out just now, I wished he could have heard me tell
him so.&nbsp; He was very good to me, he was!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be asked, is the above an over-drawn picture of what is
frequently observable in coroners&rsquo; <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>courts?&nbsp;
If answered in the negative! surely the time has come for the
reception of additional evidence, with the view, not only to
improvement in accordance with the age in which we live, but for
the maintenance of the legitimate object for which
coroners&rsquo; courts were first established, and which they
profess to uphold in all the integrity of seeking <i>the
truth</i>, <i>the whole truth</i>, <i>and nothing but the
truth</i>.&nbsp; Under these circumstances it becomes an
imperative duty to record cases where discrepancies exist or have
existed.</p>
<p>Case 1.&mdash;In the village of R&mdash;, a few years since, a
young woman denying her guilt to the latest moment, was one
morning discovered by her relatives entering her bed room,
apparently in a dying state.&nbsp; Observing the clothes
saturated with blood, they sent for a medical gentlemen, who
immediately attended, and soon ascertained that the cause of the
hemorrhage arose from her having been recently confined.&nbsp; On
accusing her of the fact and enquiring where she had put the
child&mdash;with quivering lip and trembling hand, she pointed to
the opposite side of the bed, beneath which, was a box,
containing the body of a full-grown infant.&nbsp; Externally it
appeared perfectly healthy, but the face was dark and tumid,
especially the lower part and around the neck, a mark, as if a
cord had been tightly held or fastened, was distinctly
visible.&nbsp; At the coroner&rsquo;s inquest held shortly after,
the medical <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>attendant deposed, that collateral evidence proved the
child was born alive, and the mark alluded to, corroborated his
opinion that the child had been strangled.&nbsp; On this
evidence, and this evidence alone, as no cord, tape or missile
could be found, the jury, at the coroner&rsquo;s suggestion,
returned a verdict of &ldquo;wilful murder.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
following Assizes, in Norwich, the judge who tried the culprit,
elicited from the medical gentleman, that it was possible for the
child to be strangled in its birth from natural causes&mdash;that
the cord or funis belonging to the child, itself might surround
the neck, and by impeding its birth, produce strangulation and
death.&nbsp; Under the direction of the judge, the jury
immediately returned a verdict of &ldquo;not guilty,&rdquo; and
the prisoner returned home to her friends, who rejoiced in her
acquittal, and believed her an injured person.</p>
<p>Had the coroner at the inquest ascertained the above fact, she
would not have been committed to be tried for murder under his
warrant, but for misdemeanour, concealing the birth of her
child.&nbsp; Thus she narrowly and properly escaped the
punishment for the capital offence, but improperly escaped the
punishment which would have been awarded her by the offended laws
of her country, for conduct she richly merited and deserved.</p>
<p>Case 2.&nbsp; The wife of an agricultural labourer, in the
parish of I&mdash; was in the habit of going to work <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>in the
fields, and leaving her children without fire or food from
morning till night, and if on her return she found them crying or
murmuring, she would flog and send them to bed supperless.&nbsp;
One of the poor children was attacked by the measles, and
although the eruption had partially made its appearance, she
carried it to the field where she worked, laid the child under a
fence, as it was too ill to sit up, and there it continued the
whole day, part of the time exposed to a fog off the German
ocean, which rendered the surrounding atmosphere cold, moist and
insalubrious.&nbsp; Returning homewards in the evening with her
child, she observed it was getting worse, and two or three hours
after, she asked a neighbour to come and see it, which she did,
and advised the mother to send immediately for the parish
surgeon.&nbsp; He promptly attended, but gave no hopes for its
long surviving, as it was labouring under acute inflammation of
the lungs, and in a few hours after his opinion was verified, for
the child expired.&nbsp; Some days elapsed before an inquest was
held over the deceased.&nbsp; The parish surgeon deposed the
child died from inflammation of the lungs, following the
measles.&nbsp; On being asked whether he did not think death was
accelerated, owing to the child being exposed to cold, he said
&ldquo;No! on the contrary, I consider it
beneficial.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this instance, the medical gentleman
was requested by the coroner to re-consider <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>his
statement, as he had always understood by checking such
eruptions, they were liable to be fatal&mdash;but the parish
surgeon would not retract, and the coroner rested satisfied, by
merely reprimanding and cautioning the woman to take better care
of her children.</p>
<p>Thus was inhumanity shielded in its career; as if the life of
a child might be sacrificed with impunity.</p>
<p>Case 3.&nbsp; The daughter of a respectable tradesman, in the
parish of I&mdash;unknown to a part of her family, gave birth to
an infant.&nbsp; At four months old, she introduced it for a
short time amongst them, as belonging to somebody else.&nbsp;
When about to leave home, she engaged another woman to carry it
part of the road she was going, promising she would soon overtake
her.&nbsp; On reaching the village of L&mdash;, a distance of
four miles from whence she started, the woman looked at the
infant attentively, and thought it was dying.&nbsp; Being
alarmed, she entered the first public house she came to, imparted
her suspicions, and on close examination, found her fear was not
groundless, for the infant had ceased to exist.&nbsp; A
coroner&rsquo;s inquest was summoned, and evidence given that the
parent had expressed other than a mother&rsquo;s fondness for her
child.&nbsp; Laudanum had been purchased the night previously,
from a shopkeeper in the village by her order, and on receiving
it, she tore off the <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>label which denoted the deadly
poison, and the phial was subsequently found emptied of its
contents.&nbsp; Here apparently a link in the chain of evidence
was broken.&nbsp; Two medical gentlemen who made a post mortem
examination of the body, deposed that laudanum had been
administered to the child, but they were not prepared to say in
sufficient quantity to cause death. <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<p>A verdict under the coroner&rsquo;s direction, was recorded
that the child died by the visitation of God; but material
evidence from other witnesses was withheld, which might have
unveiled the mystery surrounding the death of the innocent, and
the strongly suspected parties might have been brought to
justice.</p>
<p>It is generally known, sooner or later, to habitual drunkards,
that too much indulgence in strong beverages, particularly
spirituous liquours, is followed by becoming more and more
susceptible to their intoxicating effects, although partaken of
in smaller quantities.&nbsp; This is owing to established facts;
the liver becomes diseased, the nervous system becomes shattered,
the brain itself participates in the mischief, so that reason
losing its sway in the earlier period becomes permanently
injured, and either madness or imbecility; premature age, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>or organic
disease are the inevitable consequences.&nbsp; From the cradle to
the grave, a predisposition to decay exists in every one which
would far more frequently lie latent, until Old Mortality could
no longer stay, did not this, the most disgraceful of
all-exciting causes, thus step in and cut the thread of life when
least expected, and probably least prepared.</p>
<p>Such was the case with a schoolmaster, who when living,
resided in the village of H&mdash;.&nbsp; He prematurely suffered
from Idiopathic irritation of the bladder, for on carefully
sounding him, no stone could be detected, and therefore it was
conceived, that inflammatory action in that viscus existed, which
accompanied with pain at intervals, especially during the night
annoyed him exceedingly.&nbsp; Disease advancing, he consulted a
general practitioner in the neighbourhood, and subsequently other
medical men, among them an eminent physician in Norwich.&nbsp;
But the obstinacy of the disease soon caused his confidence to be
shaken, and fearing the result, he yielded to the foolish
solicitation of meddling acquaintance, who persuaded him to
consult a notorious quack.&nbsp; Complying with their wish, he
followed the advice given by the remorseless pretender to
knowledge in disease, and applied bullock&rsquo;s milts to the
feet, partook of stimulants (ammonia and spirits of turpentine)
in the day, with brandy and laudanum at night; on taking only two
doses of the former, his anguish increased <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>considerably,
which became partially allayed by the laudanum, but no sleep
succeeded&mdash;the expression &ldquo;the complaint has flown
upwards,&rdquo; escaped the lips of the dying man, and delirium
closed the scene.</p>
<p>To consult the accelerator of his death&mdash;the iniquitous
quack&mdash;he undertook a journey of forty miles, only four days
previously; and although the disease might eventually have killed
him, still his condition was good, emaciation had made but little
progress, and his appetite continued excellent.&nbsp; From taking
stimulants, the gradual decay of nature was denied him.&nbsp; His
agony was such, that in cases like his, an Infinite and Merciful
Being has wisely ordained that collapse should take place, that
the nervous system should receive a lasting shock, and thus was
the schoolmaster the victim of credulity, relieved of his earthly
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Such a sudden termination in the death of this unfortunate
being naturally aroused the attention of the neighbours.&nbsp; A
coroner&rsquo;s inquest was summoned, and the gentleman in office
proceeded to his duty; but the cause of death not being
ascertained to the mutual understanding of himself and jury, an
adjournment took place.&nbsp; In this instance, though informed
that a general practitioner in the neighbourhood attended the
schoolmaster in the earlier period of his illness, yet the
coroner neglected to call him as evidence, but observed to the
jury he should take the phials left in the possession of <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the friends
of the deceased, to have the contents analyzed.&nbsp; Returning
homewards, he called on a medical gentlemen, stated his mission,
and requested he would on a day named, attend and give
evidence.&nbsp; This was assented to, and on the investigation
being resumed, the question put to the witness was &ldquo;What is
the nature of the disease, and the cause of death?&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;He could not tell, as he had not been consulted
by the deceased during his illness, but he believed the medicine
prescribed was harmless&mdash;would neither kill nor
cure&mdash;although he did not approve of the
treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the coroner rested satisfied with this superficial
enquiry in search of truth, and addressing a readily assenting
jury, advised a verdict should be recorded that the deceased died
by the &ldquo;Visitation of God;&rdquo; and thus was suffered to
escape, one of the finest opportunities to expose and punish the
unpardonable vanity of a dabbler in physic, who openly, yet
certainly, disclosed the fact that he and his fraternity are
allowed to deprive with impunity the lives of the weak minded,
the most to be pitied among Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.</p>
<p>Case 5.&nbsp; The last example necessary to quote at present,
more recently occurred in a village in the county of Norfolk,
which requires peculiar notice and consideration, owing to the
respectability of persons connected with the affair.</p>
<p>Reports of an extraordinary character had been <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>in
circulation several weeks before the event transpired; and this
enquiry actually rested on what is termed in medical language
Mala Praxis. <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<p>A poor agricultural labourer, William Swann, came to an
untimely end, through circumstances of an aggravated character,
leaving a widow and nine children to deplore his irreparable
loss; for among this, the humblest classes of society, there are
ties of affection naturally entwined by which they are endeared
to each other, more than is frequently observable among grades of
a similar character in towns or cities.&nbsp; From their means
being limited, their fare less sumptuous, their sayings and
doings more immediately exposed, and their abodes being apart
from the habits, bustle, and temptations existing in more
populous neighbourhoods, <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>are satisfactory reasons for the
truth of the above assertion.</p>
<p>The unfortunate deceased observed his health giving way in the
month of August last year, and he consulted the parish surgeon,
Mr. John Coleby, who found him labouring under irritation of the
left kidney, produced by the detention of gravel, which lodging
there, pained him exceedingly.&nbsp; The treatment suggested, was
attended with various results, sometimes he was relieved for a
few days, then he relapsed, and after several weeks illness, a
small stone escaped into the bladder.</p>
<p>Swann&rsquo;s health, however continuing impaired, his wife
replied to various inquiries, &ldquo;he was no better,&rdquo; and
having remarked that she considered the parish surgeon
inattentive, a warm-hearted lady, (Mrs. Shirley) expressed a wish
that the poor man should consult her medical man, Dr. Bell,
residing in Norwich, in whose skill and medicine she had great
confidence.&nbsp; Swann consented&mdash;was placed by Dr. Bell,
on his arrival in Norwich, under the care of Mrs.
Phillips&rsquo;, and the testimony of the different witnesses at
the inquest, afterwards held on the body of the deceased,
proclaims the result.</p>
<p>The evidence first called, was Mrs. Swann, the widow of the
deceased, who stated &ldquo;My husband was 45 years of age.&nbsp;
In the early part of last harvest he was very ill, and he applied
to the <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>parish doctor, Mr. Coleby, who attended him until after
Christmas, and I told Mrs. Shirley, I did not think Mr. Coleby
did justice to him, so she sent him to Norwich to be under her
medical man, Dr. Bell.&nbsp; He went on Wednesday, the 11th of
February, in a carrier&rsquo;s cart, and took lodgings of a Mrs.
Phillips, in Union Place.&nbsp; He told me that Dr. Bell attended
him the same day, that he went up and passed five instruments
into his body.&nbsp; He said that Dr. Bell hurt him very much and
he (Dr. Bell) passed his instrument up further, which caused a
large stream of blood to come from him.&nbsp; Dr. Bell gave him
some medicine and continued to attend him a fortnight, when he
said he would not take any more.&nbsp; On hearing him say so, Dr.
Bell asked him who he would have come to him, he said Mr. Webber,
as he was with him when Dr. Bell passed the instruments.&nbsp;
Dr. Bell wrote to Mr. Webber to attend, but he would not; I went
to Norwich that day, and by my husband&rsquo;s desire I called on
Mr. Webber, and asked him to come and see him; he came and
examined him, and said inflammation had taken place, but he would
do his best endeavours for him.&nbsp; Mr. Webber attended him
five weeks, and he came home on the 30th of March last.&nbsp; Mr.
Coleby attended him the next day, and continued to attend him
until he died, on Friday, the 14th of May&mdash;he frequently
complained of his kidneys.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>The
next evidence was Margaret Phillips, an experienced nurse, who
stated &ldquo;Her lodgings and services were engaged by Dr. Bell,
and that the deceased was placed under her care, on the 11th of
February&mdash;she was present when Dr. Bell sounded him for
stone, which was done in the presence of Mr. Webber.&nbsp; The
instruments he used with considerable force, but he could not
succeed in passing them.&nbsp; The poor man suffered very much,
which no doubt induced Mr. Webber to call out &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not my way of sounding, let me try.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Dr. Bell
refused.&nbsp; He jumped up and getting another sound, attempted
to pass it with no better success.&nbsp; I called out &ldquo;Dr.
Bell, the instrument is cold, for God&rsquo;s sake have some hot
water, and oil it well,&rdquo; for previously he had only oiled
it slightly.&nbsp; He took my advice, he used another instrument,
and applying considerable force, he passed it through, and during
the time the patient suddenly called out &ldquo;I feel it go
through somewhere, it hurts me dreadfully.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
this, Dr. Bell said to Mr. Webber &ldquo;do you try,&rdquo; which
Mir; Webber did, but observing &ldquo;I prefer my own
sound,&rdquo; which he, without difficulty, immediately
passed.&nbsp; I saw some blood escape, not much, immediately
after Dr. Bell withdrew his instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly after the deceased went out to see about his
linen which was left at the public house where the conveyance
stopped, that had brought him to <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Norwich.&nbsp; This was a short
distance from my house, and soon returning, the deceased observed
that he was in dreadful pain, had been losing a deal of blood,
and on calling for a vessel, the blood came from him in a
stream.&nbsp; He continued to bleed some time, and becoming
alarmed, I called upon Dr. Bell to come to Swann&rsquo;s
assistance.&nbsp; He quickly attended, and soon after the
bleeding ceased.&nbsp; From that time the deceased continued to
be a great sufferer, and on Dr. Bell visiting him <i>three</i>
days after, I said to him privately, I am sure you have injured
that poor man, I never saw a man lose so much blood before from
sounding, nor yet complain of so much suffering.&nbsp; Dr. Bell
inquired of the deceased &ldquo;whether it was Mr. Webber or him
that hurt him,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;you, sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr.
Bell then asked &ldquo;are you sure it was not the other
gentleman,&rdquo; the deceased said &ldquo;No&mdash;it was you, I
did not feel Mr. Webber&rsquo;s instrument pass, he gave me no
pain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Bell continued to attend him a fortnight
or three weeks, she could not recollect which.&nbsp; No other
medical man attended during this time, but the poor man getting
worse and worse, Dr. Bell brought Mr. Webber again to see
him.&nbsp; They did not agree as to their treatment of him, Mr.
Webber suggested one course, but Dr. Bell refused to do so.&nbsp;
They left my house, and I do not know what passed, but Dr. Bell
shortly after returned, and said &ldquo;Nurse, at your peril you
are not to suffer any medical man <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>to interfere, he is not to take any
thing except from me, as Mrs. Shirley said he was to be entirely
under my care.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said &ldquo;of course Dr. Bell I do
not want to bring any medical man in, the only gentleman that has
been, you brought yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deceased had no
other medical man at that time to attend him; he continued to get
worse, and I was obliged to call up Dr. Bell one night, and then
he was very much frightened, and asked &ldquo;What can be the
cause of all this?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;The cause is what
Mr. Webber told you would be the result&mdash;ulceration,&rdquo;
and I exclaimed &ldquo;Oh! good God, what will become of the poor
woman and children?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Mrs. Shirley will
take care of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; I begged and prayed of him not to
go out of the way and leave me with a dying man without doing
something himself, or sending another medical man; he then went
up-stairs to Swann, and asked him again whether he would take his
medicine, and the man said &ldquo;No&mdash;no more,&rdquo; I
heard him say so.&nbsp; When Dr. Bell came down stairs again, he
asked &ldquo;Who can have set this man against my
medicine?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Go up-stairs and ask him in
the presence of witnesses&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Bell did so, and said,
&ldquo;My good man, who set you against me and my
medicine?&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;No one but the pain the
medicine gave me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Bell then left the house and
ceased attending him, and Mr. Webber was called in.&nbsp; He
ordered the deceased some medicine, <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and fomentations to allay pain, which
were continued several days.&nbsp; He called in Mr. Gibson to
witness the condition of the patient, for he was afraid the man
would die in the state he was then in, and they talked about
medicine and treatment.&nbsp; Mr. Gibson called once more, and
said &ldquo;the man was in good hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deceased came to my house on the 11th of February,
and left me exactly seven weeks after.&nbsp; Dr. Bell called on
me at the end of six weeks, and said that &ldquo;Mrs. Shirley
insisted on the man being sent home, and that I should not be
paid more than six weeks lodging.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;I
could not send him home on my own account; but that Mr. Webber
would send him home when he thought fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Crickmay, another surgeon had also seen Swann several times, with
Mr. Webber, and that he had nothing further to
suggest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. John Coleby deposed, &ldquo;I am a surgeon, residing at
North Walsham, and I was summoned to attend the deceased last
August; he complained of pain across the loins, particular in the
region of the left kidney, and I treated him accordingly.&nbsp;
After some time I suspected a stone had escaped into the bladder,
I passed an instrument twice without any difficulty, in November,
the first time without success, but the second time I detected a
small stone.&nbsp; At that time his health was so indifferent, as
to lead me to believe had I operated <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>upon him, his life would have been
the sacrifice.&nbsp; I then prescribed such medicine as I thought
conducive to his benefit, with a view to prepare him for the
operation, and I remarked to him previous to his going to
Norwich&mdash;put yourself under my care, you have a stone in
your bladder, but I cannot advise you to be operated upon
immediately.&nbsp; He however went to Norwich, and I called upon
the deceased whilst he was lodging at Mrs. Phillips&rsquo;.&nbsp;
I never saw a man so much altered as he was in so short a time,
which I consider to have entirely arisen from the bad treatment
he had received&mdash;I really thought he would die.&nbsp; Mr.
Webber had previously opened an abscess, which had formed in the
central lobe of the testis and pus <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> was escaping.&nbsp;
On the 30th of March last, he returned to Knapton, and I called
to see him the following day, I found him in a very debilitated
and exhausted state.&nbsp; He was then labouring under irritation
of the bladder, accompanied with an inflammatory affection of the
left kidney.&nbsp; He continued to linger nearly six weeks,
suffering great agony to the last, and on the 15th of May, I
performed a post mortem examination on the body of the deceased,
in the presence of Mr. Webber and Mr. Crickmay, of Norwich; Mr.
Evans, of Coltishall; his assistant, Mr. Tibbetts, and my own
assistant, Mr. Cheverton.&nbsp; <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>I examined the left kidney, which was
considerably enlarged, and in the renal capsule connected with
the ureter, there had evidently been inflammation, for an abscess
had formed there, which caused his death.&nbsp; I have no ill
feeling towards any one in stating it to be my firm opinion, that
this abscess, like all the others in his case, resulted from the
violence used by Dr. Bell, in passing the instrument, and that
which hastened his death.&nbsp; Since the man returned home, he
told me frequently &lsquo;he owed his death to Dr.
Bell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the coroner, turning to the jury, observed, &ldquo;The
deceased died from natural causes, shown in the evidence of Mr.
Coleby, for his death was owing to an abscess in the <i>renal</i>
capsule of the kidney, and that is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bell, who had been sitting next the coroner, in a juxta
position with one of the jury, with whom he was observed to be
often earnestly talking, then rose, and said &ldquo;He could not
leave that room without offering a defence for the sake of his
family and friends, as he perceived that his character was at
stake, and in spite of the remonstrance used by Mr. Webber.&nbsp;
Dr. Bell obtained the sanction of the court, and was proceeding
to state, that he was M.D. surgeon, when Mr. Webber objected such
was not evidence, that the coroner was at liberty to call Wm.
Bell, of Norwich, but that this witness must state his
qualification on oath.&nbsp; He was then <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>formally
sworn, and stated, &ldquo;I am a surgeon M.D. at Norwich.&nbsp;
The man was sent to me from Knapton, by Mrs. Shirley, (whose
letter the witness read.)&nbsp; The man reported to me that he
had been ill on the previous harvest&mdash;that he had been
attended by Mr. Coleby daily, and that he had been under his
treatment until he visited me on the morning of the 11th of
February.&nbsp; His symptoms led me to ask him if Mr. Coleby had
ever examined his bladder, naturally suspecting that he was
labouring under stone.&nbsp; He said that Mr. Coleby had done so,
and told him that there was no stone.&nbsp; That for months he
had passed blood, and on some occasions something remained at the
bottom of the vessel he used, if allowed to stand.&nbsp; He
appeared to be extremely weak and emaciated.&nbsp; I took him to
my house where I examined him with a sound, and immediately
detected a small stone.&nbsp; I then wrote to Mrs. Shirley, of
which I have kept a copy, but that lady has lost the
original.&nbsp; Dr. Bell then read a note in which was stated
that he had examined the man, who was in a deplorable
state.&nbsp; That he had a small stone in his bladder, and had
evidently been under a dangerous affection since last
harvest&mdash;she could adopt one of three courses&mdash;<i>she
could place him under the care of Mr. Coleby again</i>, <i>and
when his attention was more immediately directed to the case</i>,
<i>perhaps he would be more fortunate in detecting the nature of
the complaint</i>&mdash;<a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>or she could send him to the Norfolk
and Norwich Hospital&mdash;or she could place Swann under his
care, and he should be happy to attend without any charge, and
the only expense would be for his board and lodging.&nbsp;
Whatever plan should be adopted, let it be with the sanction of
Mr. Coleby, and if he found relief from that gentleman, he was
not to be taken from him, but strictly to attend to his (Dr.
Bell&rsquo;s) directions pro tempore.&nbsp; He also read a note
from Mrs. Shirley, wherein she sanctioned Swann being under his
care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man returned home that day, and remained a week
when he came again to me.&nbsp; I called upon Mr. Webber and
mentioned the ease of the poor man who had been to me, and handed
to him the two notes I received from Mrs. Shirley on the
subject.&nbsp; Mr. Webber said he was exceedingly anxious to see
the practice of Hom&aelig;opathy, and if my remedies failed in
removing the stone, he would be very glad to operate on the man,
if I would allow him.&nbsp; Accordingly on the morning of the
man&rsquo;s arrival to stop in Norwich, which was Wednesday, the
11th February, Mr. Webber accompanied me to his (Swann&rsquo;s)
lodgings, at Nurse Phillips&rsquo;.&nbsp; We sent the man up to
his room, and desired him to prepare himself&mdash;Mr. Webber,
myself, and the Nurse followed soon after.&nbsp; I then attempted
to introduce my sound into the man&rsquo;s bladder&mdash;the one
I had used before; on this <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>occasion I found the instrument from
being cold, seemed to be grasped by the uretha; I ordered the
nurse to bring some warm water, with which I warmed another
instrument and passed it through.&nbsp; Upon Mr. Webber calling
the attention of the jury to this expression, Dr. Bell said
&lsquo;I introduced it with the greatest facility.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
immediately felt a stone, and I then passed the instrument to Mr.
Webber, who said he felt it also.&nbsp; He withdrew the
instrument, and upon my solemn oath, not a particle of blood or
sign of blood followed.&nbsp; After the lapse of a minute or two,
Mr. Webber drew an instrument of a large size from his pocket and
introduced it, and he also injected some hot water.&nbsp; (Mr.
Webber here exclaimed &lsquo;hot water.&rsquo;)&nbsp; On my oath,
gentlemen, not hot water, but scalding water.&nbsp; Directly
after this instrument was withdrawn, the man left the
house.&nbsp; On my next visit, it was reported to me by the man
and the nurse, that he had been parting with a good deal of
blood, and I prescribed accordingly&mdash;I never introduced any
instrument after that.&nbsp; Every visit that I made afterwards,
I found that the man became more and more dissatisfied&mdash;he
said he was anxious to leave me and Mr. Webber and go home, and
the nurse declared that Mr. Webber had injured the man by the
injection.&nbsp; Finding that he did not improve&mdash;that his
nervous system was becoming more irritable, I called on Mr.
Webber <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the
following Wednesday morning, who observed I had done evil in
bringing the man to that woman&rsquo;s house, and we went and
visited him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The days on which Mr. Webber saw him with me, were the
11th, the 18th, and the last time, the 22nd of February.&nbsp; On
these occasions, Mr. Webber spoke to me respecting my treatment,
and that was the reason why the man&rsquo;s confidence in me was
removed&mdash;but this was not all&mdash;on the evening of
Sunday, the 22nd, Mr. Webber visited the man when I was not with
him; after doing so, he sent me a note, and here it
is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Having since I parted from you, been again summoned to the
neighbourhood of Crook&rsquo;s Place, I took the opportunity of
giving Swann another look, I saw no ground for altering the
opinion I openly expressed to you at our meeting; nor will I
suffer the real issue in the case, the security and welfare of
the patient, to be prejudiced by irreconcileable and strange
disclosures which have been made, reflecting most unfairly and
ungenerously upon me, considering the candour and frankness I
have shown towards you, but to which I shall not now further
allude, the real object of this note, being in my estimation of
far more importance than professional differences; therefore, let
me again beg of you to lose no further time in pursuing those
measures, of which you at our first meeting expressed yourself as
&ldquo;sceptical or doubtful,&rdquo; but at once to adopt more
energetic means for the relief of the sufferer.</p>
<p>Understand me, I do not mean for a moment to assert that the
inflammation which you agreed existed, may not abate or be
determined without the application of the leeches, &amp;c., but
surely the known sequel&oelig; of neglected opportunity, such as
ulceration, &amp;c. ought to be thought of, and if possible, to
be averted&mdash;they being as effects quite as mischievous in
the end, <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>as the cause&mdash;the inflammation itself; the only
difference that I ever observed, being that the one destroys
quicker than the other, but both as certainly.</p>
<p>The patient begged of me to write to Mrs. Shirley, and state
the facts of the case, and I cannot deny his request; but I will
&ldquo;nothing extenuate or aught set down in malice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you have admitted to me, that you occasionally give
half-grain doses of opium and of quinine (allopathic doses,) as
&ldquo;hom&aelig;opathic to disease&rdquo; (?) excuse my
ignorance, you will I apprehend, have no difficulty in carrying
out sound constitutional treatment, with local means, in the case
in point.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, Sir, yours in much haste,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">W. WEBBER.</p>
<p>St. Giles&rsquo;, Sunday, Feb. 22nd, 1852.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Dr. Bell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This shows that Mr. Webber went in my absence and
talked to the man.&nbsp; I had told him to leave Swann in my
hands, but instead of that, he visited him in my absence.&nbsp;
Up to that night, the nurse had invariably told me that it was
the injection which had injured him, but after that, Mr. Webber
and the nurse seemed to have set him against my treatment.&nbsp;
On Tuesday, the 24th, when I visited him, he would have nothing
to do either with me or my medicine, and the nurse suggested that
I should send for another medical man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Wednesday morning, the nurse came to me, and asked
me to see him early.&nbsp; I went immediately to him, and found
him labouring under a paroxysm of the stone.&nbsp; He declined to
receive any medicine from me.&nbsp; The nurse then suggested that
Mr. Webber should attend him&mdash;I was much surprised <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>at this, as
previously she had always abused Mr. Webber.&nbsp; I asked the
man if he wished Mr. Webber to see him, and he replied that he
did.&nbsp; About nine o&rsquo;clock the same morning, I wrote to
Mr. Webber, stating that the man refused to use my medicine, and
that he wished to see him.&nbsp; Mr. Webber sent me a note,
stating that the wife of Swann had just been, and requested that
he would take charge of her husband&rsquo;s case, which he had
promised to do.&nbsp; The man after this remained five weeks in
Norwich, during which I had nothing to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner commenced ordering strangers and witnesses to
withdraw, previous to his summing up, when Mr. Webber asked the
coroner why he had been summoned, and insisted on his right to be
heard, after the palpably incorrect statements which Dr. Bell had
been allowed to make&mdash;the coroner replied that he did not
consider it was necessary for Mr. Webber to give evidence at all.
<a name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>The foreman of the jury, (Mr.
Coleman) said &ldquo;He thought it would be no more than right,
that as Dr. Bell had made a statement, Mr. Webber should be
allowed to make a statement also;&rdquo; this opinion his brother
jurors coincided in, and much against the inclination openly
expressed, and the significence of great and frequent impatience
of the coroner during the time occupied in the delivery of the
evidence.&nbsp; Mr. Webber, after being sworn, deposed as
follows:</p>
<p>I am a M.R.C.S., Eng., residing in Norwich.&nbsp; I received a
note from Dr. Bell on the morning of the 11th of February, who
asked at what time I could see a patient of his who had been sent
by a lady, to be placed under his care, to which I returned an
answer, and agreeably to arrangement, Dr. Bell called on me, and
proceeding on our way to Mrs. Phillips&rsquo;, in Union Place, he
said he believed the patient, Wm. Swann had a stone in his
bladder.&nbsp; That Mr. John Coleby of North Walsham had examined
him, but had not found one, and he therefore wished to be
satisfied that he was correct in the opinion he had formed.&nbsp;
That he intended to treat him hom&aelig;opathically, and that if
the man should not be relieved by his treatment, about which he
was &ldquo;sceptical,&rdquo; (&ldquo;as he had had no experience
in this disease&rdquo;)&mdash;he would then hand him over to me
to be operated upon, as he believed I was fond of operating in
such cases&mdash;I told him <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>I had no fondness for cutting up
anybody, but, that when operations came in my way, and they were
necessary, I never hesitated to perform them.&nbsp; He said he
was not in the habit himself of operating in such cases.&nbsp; I
agreed to go and examine the case, stating at the same time that
I would have nothing to do with the treatment he proposed.&nbsp;
That if his system proved to be a sound one, I should not
hesitate to proclaim it as a great boon to suffering humanity,
but that if it should prove to be otherwise, he might rest
assured I should expose it.</p>
<p>Arriving at Nurse Phillips&rsquo;, I there saw Swann, who was
a man about five feet, nine or ten inches in height, in tolerably
fair plight, no emaciation, no evidence of extensive organic
disease going on, nothing beyond a slight wearing from the
irritation which generally accompanies stone in the bladder, and
with nothing in his appearance to interdict an operation after a
week or two preparation, nor to exclude the benefits of opportune
and proper treatment.</p>
<p>It is usual when a consulting surgeon is called in, to allow
him to perform the manipulation, but in this case Dr. Bell
himself passed the sound&mdash;I stood by while he attempted to
pass it, which in my opinion was of a very objectionable form,
and such a one as he would be likely to experience difficulty in
introducing, and not calculated to detect <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>the stone
when in.&nbsp; On passing it down to the commencement of
membranous portion of the urethra, he came to the check which I
had anticipated; he then made forcible attempts to pass the
instrument, despite my advice not to do so, conveyed in the words
&ldquo;Oh do not use force; pray do not use force&mdash;force
will do no good, you will do harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; That instrument
was withdrawn, but not until force had been used.&nbsp; Another
and smaller instrument was tried by him, when the nurse suggested
that he had better use some warm water, as she thought the
instrument might be cold, and she brought some.&nbsp; A further
attempt was made to pass the instrument, and more force was
applied, and Swann cried out &ldquo;Oh! sir, you have hurt me, it
has gone somewhere, I think it has gone wrong,&rdquo; of which, I
myself, entertained no doubt.&nbsp; The instrument was then
partially withdrawn, and I seeing where the difficulty existed,
recommended that this sound (producing it <a
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a>) should be passed instead, for it had
never fallen to my lot to see such unskilful manipulation as was
exhibited by Dr. Bell, whose hand shook considerably at the
time.&nbsp; He then turned the instrument and effected an
entrance into the bladder.&nbsp; He said he felt the stone, and
requested me to take the instrument, I did so, and felt a
grating, but <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>not being satisfied, I requested him to withdraw his
instrument and I would introduce mine.&nbsp; I have no doubt that
the urethra had been lacerated, for on his withdrawing his
instrument, blood dropped on my boot.&nbsp; I do not say there
was any great quantity, nor was it likely there would be, because
it became extravasated; therefore, I adopted my usual plan in
such cases, which was to introduce an instrument as large as the
passage.&nbsp; I passed the instrument into the bladder and
struck the stone, and I believe the sound was audible to the
nurse, who is accustomed to such cases.&nbsp; Dr. Bell not being
satisfied, on this, I withdrew the sound, and proceeded to inject
into the bladder tepid water, as no surgeon in his senses would
do what Dr. Bell states I did&mdash;use <i>hot</i> water, and if
he would, he could not, for the patient would not let him.&nbsp;
I then handed the instrument to Dr. Bell and turned the stop
cock, allowing water to run out, so that the stone might fall on
the end of it which it did, and was heard distinctly by those
present, and Dr. Bell having assured me he felt it distinctly, it
was withdrawn.&nbsp; During the progress of the examination, I
asked the man whether he felt any serious pain, and he said,
&ldquo;I hope you have done, for I am getting very
faint.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he was very deaf, I put the question to
him again, and asked him, did the last instrument hurt you? and
he said &ldquo;No; the last instrument did not hurt
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this was <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>done openly.&nbsp; Dr. Bell said he
was going to treat the man hom&aelig;opathically; I said
&ldquo;he might do as he pleased, he might humbug the patient,
but that he should not humbug me, and I would have nothing to do
with such treatment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Bell then mixed some
medicine in some water in a tumbler glass; it did not readily
dissolve, and he called for another tumbler, and in order to
dissolve it, he poured the contents of one tumbler into another
several times, and in the process, spilled one half of it.&nbsp;
Thus showing how important <i>these medicines</i> are in their
<i>integrity</i>.&nbsp; It was arranged that if the man was not
benefitted at the end of a month, he should pass into my hands to
be operated upon.&nbsp; I remarked to him that that time would
afford no criterion of the value of his treatment, as patients
had what is called fits of the stone, and if the fit went off, he
would take the credit of curing the man, when in fact he had done
no such thing.&nbsp; Dr. Bell states that I saw the man on
Wednesday, the 18th, but that is not correct, as on that day I
was called to and attended a patient in Cambridgeshire.&nbsp; On
the following Sunday, (the 22nd,) he came to me and asked me if I
had seen the man again, I replied certainly not&mdash;he asked me
if I would come and look at him, because said he, &ldquo;my
treatment does not appear to succeed with him, I have no great
confidence in its success.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went with him to nurse
Phillips&rsquo;, and never in my life did I behold <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>a man so
changed&mdash;his condition was that of a man suffering under
acute inflammation.&nbsp; I immediately turned up the bed
clothes, or rather the sheet, and placing my hand lightly on the
body, I was about to examine the state of the bladder, when he
shrieked violently, saying &ldquo;Oh! take away your hand,
sir&mdash;I cannot bear it&mdash;you will kill me!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
had used no pressure.&nbsp; I then turned round and said,
&ldquo;Dr. Bell, how comes this about?&nbsp; Why the man has got
inflammation of his bladder, what have you been
doing?&rdquo;&nbsp; The man was rather deaf, but he caught the
last words, and looking at Dr. Bell, said &ldquo;you have done
it; you have given me poison.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Bell remarked,
&ldquo;I have merely given him nux, <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a> because his bowels
were confined.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then said &ldquo;there is no time
to be lost; I fear the man will die; you had better put on
leeches, as soon as you can, and have recourse to fomentation,
and the sooner the better,&rdquo; when Dr. Bell remarked
&ldquo;Can we not go some where else and talk?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
said &ldquo;No, sir, whatever I do every body is welcome to see
and hear, I will be a party to nothing in the <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>dark, and I
will tell you, unless you stop this inflammation soon, it will
soon stop the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Bell said &ldquo;that he
would not take a drop of blood from the man, and he mentioned the
names of several persons who, he said, <i>knew</i> the cause of
inflammation, and that it could be stopped without
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being called into that neighbourhood on the
evening of the same day to attend a patient of my own; and being
anxious about the poor fellow, I called again at Mrs.
Phillips&rsquo;, but did <i>not</i> see the deceased.&nbsp; The
nurse said that she had used fomentation, but the man was in
great pain; I asked if Dr. Bell was there, and on her replying
that he was not, I said I would write to him, (and hence the
letter which Dr. Bell has thought proper to produce in his
defence.)&nbsp; I then took my leave&mdash;Dr. Bell continued to
attend him, on the Monday and Tuesday, and on the Wednesday, I
received a note from him, asking me when I could attend, but I
did not immediately answer it, as I saw his motive for writing in
such a way.&nbsp; After this, Swann&rsquo;s wife called upon me
and I did attend, and I found the man discharging mucous from
every mucous surface.&nbsp; Mr. Crickmay who happened to be in my
house at the time went with me, and also saw the deceased, and he
enquired as to the remedies that had been adopted; we both
thought the man was sinking&mdash;his pulse was almost
imperceptible at the wrist&mdash;his eye was vacant&mdash;the
surface of his skin was clammy, <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and there were other indications of
that general decline of power which frequently precedes
death.&nbsp; I naturally inquired what the man had been taking,
but before the nurse could answer, he said &ldquo;he has been
giving me more poison, I know it was arsenic, because I have
mixed arsenic and lime with wheat, and know the smell and taste
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the condition I found him in&mdash;I
prescribed for him, directing such treatment as I conceived to be
required to meet the exigencies of the case.&nbsp; He continued
much in the same state for four or five days, the principal
symptoms being diarrhoea, and a discharge of a small quantity of
urine, mixed with bloody mucous and pus, which he had great
difficulty in voiding.&nbsp; He then rallied somewhat, but
relapsed in a day or two, and fearing the threatened result, and
being influenced by the remarks being made out of doors, which
were loud and condemnatory of the treatment the man had received
from Dr. Bell, I thought it necessary to call in Mr. Gibson, a
medical man, with whom I was not intimate.&nbsp; On the evening
on which Mr. Gibson saw the man, he supported him while I drew
off his water, and after Mr. Gibson had examined him, he came to
the same conclusion as myself, that abscesses were forming in the
neck of the bladder, and in the tissues connecting that organ
with the adjacent structures.&nbsp; Mr. Gibson said that he had
nothing to suggest in addition to my treatment.&nbsp; <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>He saw the
man the next day, and he said there was evidence of abscesses
having burst, both in the rectum and in the urethra, for a great
deal of pus had escaped.&nbsp; For a few days the man rallied
again, but we had no hope for him at that time; and those who
understand these cases, will tell you, that when abscesses form,
as the result of injury and irritation in structures adjacent to
the bladder and its connections, they will, by a continuous
irritation in the absence of controul, lead to the perpetuation
or encroachment of similar action in similar tissues, as for
instance, an abscess in the capsule of the kidney, which has been
attested to by Mr. John Coleby as the proximate cause of death.
<a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a>&nbsp; From that time however, the man
gradually progressed, and thanks to good watching, good nursing,
and a generous diet, he recovered sufficiently to be removed
home, not with my consent, but from frequent importunities I
submitted to his going home, and he having improved, to a certain
extent, I told him that he was at liberty to please himself, as
to the future; he could either be under Mr. Coleby&rsquo;s care,
or he might return to me, and he went home on the 30th of
March.&nbsp; I heard no more of him for a fortnight, when he sent
word to me he was going on well, and that he hoped to return to
undergo <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>the operation.&nbsp; From the cause before mentioned,
and possibly owing to the less nutritious diet, another abscess
formed&mdash;after this, it appears the vital powers began to
sink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bell declined cross-examining Mr. Webber, and no other
evidence being called, the room was then cleared of strangers and
witnesses, and the jury proceeded to consider their verdict;
after deliberating about 20 minutes, the foreman returned the
following verdict:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>That William Swann died from
an abscess in the capsule of the left bladder</i>,&rdquo; but on
the suggestion of Mr. Crickmay, the coroner substituted the word
&ldquo;kidney&rdquo; for &ldquo;bladder,&rdquo; remarking that,
that was what the jury intended.&nbsp; One of the jury said that
the foreman had not given the verdict exactly as agreed upon; and
the foreman then added the words &ldquo;<i>and we are of opinion
that deceased&rsquo;s death was accelerated by improper
treatment</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Crickmay
said, by whom do you consider improper treatment was used?&nbsp;
The coroner observed &ldquo;<i>as for that</i>, <i>you and the
public are to form your own judgment</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus terminated a painful enquiry, on which a large volume
might be written in behalf of humanity, expressing regret, for
the sufferings of the <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>unfortunate deceased&mdash;expressing
regret that his care, his counsel, and his regard shown to his
wife and children should be so untimely lost&mdash;expressing
regret that the good intentions of Mrs. Shirley should
apparently, through misplaced confidence, be
frustrated&mdash;expressing regret, that a professional gentleman
standing in this case in an awkward position, should make a more
awkward defence, in apparently endeavouring to cast the blame on
others, who wholly undeserved it&mdash;expressing regret that a
member of the Royal College of Surgeons, in Ireland, <a
name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a"
class="citation">[57a]</a> who is supposed to possess an
acquaintance with the tissues and structures of the human body,
apparently forgot that the larger an instrument, called a sound,
can enter a canal at a given part, the less danger there is of
rupturing a tube, or wounding a delicate membrane.&nbsp; But
above all, expressing regret, that having apparently neglected
the precaution given by Mr. Webber not to use force; having
witnessed the agony accompanying inflammatory action which
followed, he persisted to combat it by such apparently vague
medical treatment. <a name="citation57b"></a><a
href="#footnote57b" class="citation">[57b]</a>&nbsp; For this it
appears was nearly sending Swann to a still earlier grave.&nbsp;
His life, however was for a time preserved through the skill and
perseverance of Mr. Webber, and the great attention <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Mrs.
Phillips, the nurse, paid to the deceased.&nbsp; But the days of
the poor agricultural labourer were numbered; and his earthly
sufferings having ceased, an earnest hope may be expressed that
his ethereal spirit&mdash;his soul, may be now slumbering in the
bosom of his Father, and his God.</p>
<p>The cases narrated, plainly demonstrate that care, tact,
delicacy, and discernment, are required at coroners&rsquo;
inquests&mdash;for a two-fold object must be kept in
view:&mdash;the one to ascertain the proximate cause of death,
whether arising from natural or mechanical events, and the other,
whether the law can take cognizance of, and bring to justice the
incautious, the ill-disposed, and possibly the gross offender
against the laws of his country.</p>
<p>To the departed, these duties are of little moment, but to the
living, they demand the greatest attention, not the less owing to
the voice of humanity towards the friends of the deceased than to
individuals, who innocent or guilty, may be directly or
indirectly, suspected or implicated, in conniving or hastening,
the death of a fellow creature.</p>
<p>It may be inferred, that jurymen <a name="citation58"></a><a
href="#footnote58" class="citation">[58]</a> ought to assert <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>their right
<a name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a> (whilst the memories of learned
coroners are sleeping) to ask questions, necessary to obtain
evidence, that their minds may be so enlightened, as to record
just and complete verdicts, even in Mala Praxis, for why should
truth be withheld, when the Science of Medicine, with sound
surgery for its helpmate, are being sullied in glory?</p>
<p>But it must be borne in mind, that a jury of men labouring in
other vocations, living in a remote village, seldom attending
coroners&rsquo; inquests, whose education is so limited, as not
to be competent to seek for information, which the knowledge of
medical jurisprudence inculcates, are the reasons why they must
and do rely on the coroner to extract the evidence required; that
their ideas of right and wrong may rest on the solid foundation
of truth itself, which cannot be effected, unless the judge on
obtaining evidence, explains the law bearing on the question, and
introduces both, suitably to their comprehension. <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a></p>
<p>Unless this object is realized, coroners&rsquo; inquests <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>are perfectly
useless, and evidently prove there must be something
&ldquo;rotten in the state of Denmark,&rdquo; which if enquired
into, will be found to prevail in many instances even where
gentlemen in the legal profession are coroners.&nbsp; But how can
it be otherwise?&nbsp; Their knowledge of medical jurisprudence,
if to a certain extent comprehended, must be far too limited to
conduct enquiries of grave importance.&nbsp; The want of sound
medical knowledge must prove the hindrance, because it is
frequently observed when medical gentlemen give evidence, they
use technicalities employed in the profession, and by stepping
into details, they bewilder their hearers, and sometimes
themselves also. <a name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a>&nbsp; Therefore it may be assumed, that
great tact and discrimination is required in the examination in
any case where medical evidence is of paramount importance, and
consequently it may be believed, that unless gentlemen are
properly educated, so as to be able to elicit important truths
connected with the science of medicine in all its branches, as
well as the legal points in coronership, they cannot be capable
of conducting inquiries, in all the integrity, which these solemn
occasions demand.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the following queries may not be deemed
impertinent or superfluous:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Is it
customary for coroners to be petulant, irascible, and over
desirous to close their enquiries?</p>
<p>Is it customary for witnesses to omit signing the depositions
of their evidences?</p>
<p>Is it customary for coroners to allow disputations to exist in
their presence, which do not appear to harmonize with the solemn
character of coroners&rsquo; courts?</p>
<p>Is it customary with coroners to omit calling evidence that
might be material towards corroborating testimonies where
conflicting evidences arise, or links in the chain of evidence
are broken?</p>
<p>Is it customary for coroners previous to summing up, to order
their courts to be cleared of witnesses, strangers, and
reporters, who had been admitted to hear the evidence?</p>
<p>Is it customary for coroners to summon witnesses <i>in
person</i>, especially in cases of adjournment, where grave
evidence has previously been given on oath?</p>
<p>Is it customary for coroners at adjourned inquests, to call
upon parties, in person, suspected of felony, to inform them of
it?</p>
<p>Is it customary for coroners to allow suspected parties
present at inquests, to hold earnest conversation with jurymen,
during enquiry?</p>
<p>In inquests of grave importance, is it advisable for coroners
to summon jurymen all of one parish, especially if the jurymen
are directly or indirectly <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>connected with parties accessory
before the facts, in cases of suspected felony?</p>
<p>If coroners doubt the veracity of a medical witness, and they
state their reasons for doing so, are they not bound to suggest
to the jury the propriety of calling other medical witnesses?</p>
<p>Is it customary for coroners to omit to recapitulate the
evidence at the summing up, and neglect to explain the bearings
of the law upon the various issues?</p>
<p>Is it customary for coroners to dictate verdicts, instead of
leaving juries to come to their own unbiassed, deliberate, and
honest conclusions?</p>

<h3>OPINIONS of the PRESS on the FIRST EDITION.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The work is another interesting addition to
Norfolk literature, and the plan for the conservation of our
Northern shores, is worthy attention, as coming from a gentleman,
who, to some experience at least, adds the claim of having paid
considerable attention to a subject of no little importance to
the Northern and Eastern districts of the County.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Norwich Mercury</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;The subject of this Essay is indeed of prime
importance&mdash;First in a national point of view, as embracing
particularly the interest of the public, and concerning in the
closest manner the preservation of all the property of
individuals situated on the contour of the coast of Norfolk, from
the North Westerly point at Wells, to the Haven of Great
Yarmouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main object of the enquiry is to discover the best
plan of restraining the ravages of the sea, during the periods of
extraordinary high tides; and on this point we entirely agree
with Mr. Hewitt&rsquo;s general view, and are strongly inclined
to believe that it will answer in most cases where it may be
judiciously carried into effect&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Norfolk News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The publication of this volume may be considered well
timed.&nbsp; It contains much information respecting the tides
and currents of the ocean&mdash;the formation of the Norfolk
Coast&mdash;the damage done by irruptions of the sea,
&amp;c.&nbsp; We are no engineers, therefore we do not pretend to
pronounce upon the merits of Mr. Hewitt&rsquo;s plan for the
construction of jetties, breakwaters, &amp;c.; but it appears
feasible, and merits the consideration of those whose property
has been, and is threatened to be injured by the incursions of
the ocean.&nbsp; And we consider the work (which is dedicated to
the Lords of the Admiralty,) to be creditable to the industry of
the Author.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Norfolk Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author is a gentleman, whose profession (a
surgeon,) could hardly be supposed to allow him much time to
devote to a subject such earnest thought and investigation, as
the one he has here attacked.&nbsp; Mr. Hewitt, however, has
evidently applied himself to this question con amore, and the
work now before us evinces that he has brought to its
consideration, a mind capable of patient and careful research
into the many and varied causes that bear upon it.&nbsp; Though
undertaken more especially with a view to searching out and
propounding a remedy for the locality of which it immediately
treats, a considerable portion of the work refers to the
Encroachments of the Ocean generally, upon all exposed points of
the coast, and there is much in it that would apply to the
Southern, as forcibly as to the Eastern coast</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hewitt describes the plan which he recommends as
the best mode of imposing a check to the Encroachments of the
Ocean, and shows the supposed elevation of the beach from the
deposit of sand likely to be caused by the inventor&rsquo;s
plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work is written in an earnest, but modest and
unpretending style, and the aim of the author is so good and
praiseworthy, that should it fail to make the impression on head
quarters, desired by its writer, he will, under all
circumstances, have the satisfaction of feeling that he has
laboured in a good cause.&nbsp; While other minds may perhaps
entertain different views as to the utility or practicability of
his scheme, they cannot fail to admit Mr. Hewitt deserves the
thanks of his country, for the benevolent motives which have
actuated, and the patient and diligent care which has directed
his efforts in the field in which he has thus become a
labourer.&rdquo;</p>

physician or surgeon without license.&nbsp; In either case, if a
party having a competent degree of skill and knowledge, makes an
accidental mistake in the treatment of a patient, through which
mistake death ensues, he is not thereby guilty of
manslaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if where proper medical assistance can be had, a
person totally ignorant of the science of medicine&mdash;takes on
himself a violent and dangerous remedy to one labouring under
disease, and death ensues in consequence of that dangerous remedy
having been so administered, then he is guilty of manslaughter;
or a man may be guilty of manslaughter if, notwithstanding <i>he
has a competent knowledge of medicine</i>, <i>he be guilty of
gross rashness in the application of a remedy or gross negligence
in attending his patient afterwards</i>.&nbsp; Also, where a man
doing a lawful act, which is at the same time dangerous, he
neglects to use <i>proper caution</i>, death ensues, if it takes
place within a <i>twelve month</i> and a day; but if his life
exceeds that period, the law will presume that his death
proceeded from some other cause than the wound.&rdquo;&mdash;1

<p>&ldquo;If a man be sick of a disease which in all likelihoods
would terminate his life, and another give him a <i>wound or hurt

would constitute murder.&rdquo;&mdash;See 1 Lord Hale,

examination.&nbsp; Mr. Webber observed, &ldquo;Sir, you cannot be
in doubt upon that score, as you must admit, on the 15th of May,
I enclosed you a note from Mr. Pilgrim, your brother coroner, to
whom, supposing him to have been the coroner for the district, I
mentioned all the circumstances connected with the deceased, and
he conceived it was a proper case, in justice to all parties,
that an inquiry should take place; and sir, I apprehend I have
done your friend, on your left, no injustice, by getting his own
friend Mr. Coleby to examine the body, for you cannot suppose,
that the very cordial manner in which you saw Mr. Coleby shake
Dr. Bell by the hand, he could have had any unfair or ill feeling

used by Dr. Bell, aggravated the misery of the sufferer, possibly
that gentleman, who it appears was educated in the Allopathic
School, might have used them in larger doses than is prescribed
by a real disciple of the German Hahnemann.&nbsp; Be this as it
may, it furnishes a precious example to those who follow such
vague practise in grave disease, where the life of the afflicted
verges on eternity.&nbsp; Yet, surely, none but vain and ignorant
people, assumed or real, can believe in the shadow of a shade,

judiciously so) that the immediate and direct right of deciding
upon questions of law is entrusted to the court, while in the
jury, it is at most only incidental; that in the exercise of this
incidental right, the latter are not only placed under the
superintendence of the former, but in some degree controllable by
them; and therefore, that in all points of law during an

provokingly incomprehensible to others.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
